# Initial Draft 

## Problem Statement 
There is a library ABC that hosts over 10,000 books and scholarly articles that can be accessed physically and digitally respectively. The library also has several visitors, but only a handful of librarians to attend to the visitors’ requests. This is not an efficient library management system since there is too much load on the librarians when the number of visitors increases. Therefore, a system that simulates the presence of a librarian performing the tasks that is requested by a user is an optimal solution to this problem. In other words, an intelligent bot that understands the user’s requests and responds to the queries that the user would otherwise pose to a human librarian, in a way that a human librarian would respond is a practical solution that caters to the needs of the librarian as well as the users of the library. In addition to giving a hand to the librarians in assisting the visitors, the bot also offers a special feature that a human might find it difficult to perform. The bot also assists the users in what source or material they are looking for in the cases that the users are not sure about what they are looking for but only have an idea. 
## Bot Description
The bot designed to assist the users in their requests can perform all the tasks that a human librarian would do. The user can chat with the bot in the same way that they would with a human librarian and pose their queries or requests. 

The bot should be able to issue books, accept the returned books and organize them back, accordingly, answer frequently asked questions about the facilities available in the library and other services, and perform text mining that enables to render suggestions of sources or materials to the user when they are not aware of what specific source they are looking for. 

The bot is developed to have a chat with the user and extract the requests and hence respond to them accordingly. 

This bot is essentially a chat bot with the features of an EventBot. ?
