   "libraries": {
     "numpy": "NumPy is a very popular python library for large multi-dimensional array and matrix processing, with the help of a large collection of high-level mathematical functions. It is very useful for fundamental scientific computations in Machine Learning. It is particularly useful for linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. High-end libraries like TensorFlow uses NumPy internally for manipulation of Tensors. https://numpy.org/ https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/",
     "scipy": "SciPy is a very popular library among Machine Learning enthusiasts as it contains different modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration and statistics. There is a difference between the SciPy library and the SciPy stack. The SciPy is one of the core packages that make up the SciPy stack. SciPy is also very useful for image manipulation. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scipy/index.htm",
     "scikitlearn": "Scikit-learn is one of the most popular ML libraries for classical ML algorithms. It is built on top of two basic Python libraries, viz., NumPy and SciPy. Scikit-learn supports most of the supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. Scikit-learn can also be used for data-mining and data-analysis, which makes it a great tool who is starting out with ML. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-python",
     "tensorflow": "TensorFlow is a very popular open-source library for high performance numerical computation developed by the Google Brain team in Google. As the name suggests, Tensorflow is a framework that involves defining and running computations involving tensors. It can train and run deep neural networks that can be used to develop several AI applications. TensorFlow is widely used in the field of deep learning research and application. https://www.tensorflow.org/ https://www.tensorflow.org/guide https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials",
     "keras": "Keras is a very popular Machine Learning library for Python. It is a high-level neural networks API capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It can run seamlessly on both CPU and GPU. Keras makes it really for ML beginners to build and design a Neural Network. One of the best thing about Keras is that it allows for easy and fast prototyping. https://keras.io/ https://blog.keras.io/category/tutorials.html",
     "pytorch": "PyTorch is a popular open-source Machine Learning library for Python based on Torch, which is an open-source Machine Learning library which is implemented in C with a wrapper in Lua. It has an extensive choice of tools and libraries that supports on Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing(NLP) and many more ML programs. It allows developers to perform computations on Tensors with GPU acceleration and also helps in creating computational graphs. https://pytorch.org/ https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html https://pytorch.org/tutorials/",
     "pandas": "Pandas is a popular Python library for data analysis. It is not directly related to Machine Learning. As we know that the dataset must be prepared before training. In this case, Pandas comes handy as it was developed specifically for data extraction and preparation. It provides high-level data structures and wide variety tools for data analysis. It provides many inbuilt methods for groping, combining and filtering data.https://pandas.pydata.org  https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/tutorials.html"
