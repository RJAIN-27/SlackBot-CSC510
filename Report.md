## State of affairs addressed by our bot:
With the explosion of Machine Learning applications in every field, it has become important for every organization to use and understand these applications and APIs, effectively.

There are many such APIs and the popular ones are those offered by Python. But understanding the usage of these APIs, and in general the process of Machine Learning is still unclear to many which makes it complex for users who are not experts. 

The information available online regarding the usage of such APIs and libraries is vast and diverse. It is tedious to scout around a multitude of these sources and nail down on a satisfying answer and proceed with the implementation. Therefore, having a solution that answers questions regarding these libraries and the implementation on datasets, posed by users of these APIs, in a concise and satisfying manner, all under the same roof, especially when the users are unclear about what has to be done with a dataset, is certainly beneficial. This is what our bot aims at achieving. 

Our bot, L.I.B.R.A. (Library-Intensive Bot for Recommendation Assistance) helps the users in understanding the ML APIs of Python in a concise and systematic manner, by responding to the userâ€™s requests. The bot is also primarily developed to aid the users in understanding the dataset, as well as what model has to be applied on the users' dataset, by applying a series of elegant machine learning techniques internally on the dataset. This way the users get the solution to their questions all under one roof.
